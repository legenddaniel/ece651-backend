# Tutorial

- Install only Python (â‰¥ 3.9) and Docker on your machine. You may need quite some settings for Docker.
- Open project in code editor. Create `.env` at root dir.
- Open terminal at root dir, run `./leh build` then `./leh start`. The server is running properly if you see:
```
...
db_1   | 2022-01-16 19:21:20.950 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
...
app_1  | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
- Run `./leh django createsuperuser` to create admin user. Then you can log in to the Django admin `localhost:8000/admin`.
- It is recommended to stop the container by running `./leh stop`.

# Tips

- Install Python libs by adding it to `requirements.txt` in proper format instead of running `pip install`.
- Run `./leh` for shell command helper. `leh` is a developer-friendly shell script with some commonly-used commands. Currently django commands can only run using `leh`.
- You may need to clean dangling images in docker from time to time. They are usually marked as `<none>`.

# Selenium System Test
- Selenium system tests (**@tag(selenium-system)**):
    1. user signup => user login => add shipping address => change shipping address
    2. user signup => user login => search for a product => add it to cart => add address => place order
- To run selenium system tests:
    1. remove all existing L'EH-related running containers 
    2. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.selenium.yml run --name app --rm app python3 manage.py test --teg=selenium-system`
    3. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.selenium.yml down`
- Each selenium system test should be placed in a separate test file to avoid driver error.
